At my high school, I was in the engineering department and decided to TA for the "Engineering Tech II" class for my senior year. Along with two other TAs, the teacher had assigned us to measure and design a bench similar to the picture above for the school as a year-long project. We had to reference the picnic tables that the school already had posted around and measured each part individually.

Once we had all the parts measured out, we had to use AutoDesk Inventor to model the bench. AutoDesk Inventor is a 3-D modeling software that allows you to shape various objects and combine them together for a final object. I was in charge of putting all the pieces together once we had 3-D modeled each individual part. Sadly, we never got to see if the bench was ever made since we graduated the following year.
