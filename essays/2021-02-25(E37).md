## What are Frameworks?
Frameworks are like the hand-holders of website development. Frameworks reduce a LOT of time needed for desigining a webpage because it can automatically format things for you, which is a huge relief when working on pages that require a lot of subsections. Since frameworks are also  pre-made, that means they are tested and are therefore very reliable sources to use. This allows for programmers to create neatly designed pages while also minimalizing the code needed. As a result, many websites use frameworks such as Semantic UI to make their pages stand out more to viewers.
