## What are Frameworks?
Frameworks are like the hand-holders of website development; they often guide you to building a beautifully designed webpage. Frameworks reduce a LOT of time needed for desigining a webpage because it can automatically format things for you, which is a huge relief when working on pages that require a lot of subsections. Since frameworks are also  pre-made, that means they are tested and are therefore very reliable sources to use. This allows for programmers to create neatly designed pages while also minimalizing the code needed. As a result, many websites use frameworks such as Semantic UI to make their pages stand out more to viewers.

## Semantic UI and my Experience 
Created by LESS and jQuery, Semantic UI is an example of a framework used by a plethora of webdesigners. Although it is not the newest framework made, dating back to 2014 when it was officially released, there are a lot of useful features that Semantic UI uses to differentiate it from other frameworks. According to the [Semantic UI website](https://semantic-ui.com/), they claim to have concise html since "Classes use syntax from natural languages like noun/modifier relationships, word order, and plurality to link concepts intuitively." This will be very evident when working with this framework, since the syntax is truly as basic as the founders describe them as.
