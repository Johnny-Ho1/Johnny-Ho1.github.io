## Introduction
  The first step in becoming a smarter person is being able to know where and how to obtain knowledge. A popular way to do so is by asking questions from more experienced and knowledgeable people and learning from them. However, there are two ways to ask a question; the smart way and the bad way. The smart way of asking questions allows the person asking to receive more information compared to someone asking a question in a bad way. So, how can you differentiate a smart question from a bad one? Authors Eric Steven Raymond and Rick Moen wrote an elaborate [essay](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) on this specific topic for people who are trying to get better at coding, giving tips on how to ask good questions and how to stop yourself from creating bad questions. 

## Smart Quetions
A common place for questions to be asked, especially for programming troubleshooting, is Stack Overflow. Stack Overflow has thousands, if not millions of questions posted on the website, filled with both smart and bad questions. An example of a smart question can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1642028/what-is-the-operator-in-c). The title of this question is a concise question "What is the “-->” operator in C++?". The author of this forum post starts off by giving context for his question, providing a hyperlink to his reference. The author then puts the input code and the output code before finally elaborating on their original question. This forum post is a perfect example of a smart question since it is straight to the point, conetxt for the question is provided, and the question allows for specific answers from experts.

## Bad Questions
[This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65950007/execute-exe-from-memory) is an example of a bad question. In fact, I had to go back and edit this essay because this question ended up being closed down for being bad. So, what did the author do in this post for other people to flag this question down for being bad?


## So, How do You Apply This?
