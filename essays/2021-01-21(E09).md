Starting from a very early age, I was a child that would always be on the computer. Computers fascinated me since they could perform a myriad of tasks at lightning speed. Trying to understand how a computer worked really intrigued me. As a result I knew from the start that I would grow attatched to computers and would most likely be working with it in my future.

That leads me to where I am right now, taking ICS 314 in my spring 2021 semester. Although I have a very strong interest in computers, I realized after taking a few ICS courses that my coding is on the weaker side. I have a harder time problem solving compared to most people so I often take a long time to code something, with no exception to the newly learned Javascript language. So far, although I am still struggling with the WODs (often hitting the DNF+ times), I feel like Javascript has been easier to pick up compared to Java and C/C++. I feel like Javascript allows for code to be more flexible (an example would be being able to use let and const for variables), which is really helpful for programming from a software engineering perspective. 

I think the athletic software engineering is really helpful since, as mentioned before, my coding is on the weaker side. So far, the WODs and bWODs have been treating me fine although I personally think that I am taking too long to solve some of the simpler problems. This kind of learning is new for me, so hopefully I adapt fast so I have a less stressful time in the class in the future. I have enjoyed the past WOD/bWODs that I have done but I am not sure if I will feel the same towards the future as the problems get longer and harder.
