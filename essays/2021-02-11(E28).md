## What are Coding Standards?
Coding standards for me, is one of the most important things that any progammer should be proficient in when creating or working on a project. Coding standards are coding rules/guidelines to better develop a program. Coding is like a language, and coding standards are like the rules of the language that help make everything comprehensible to other people. Coding standards help collaborators or peers edit a program while keeping the "look" of the code consistent. 

## What do Coding Standards Look Like?
The best way to show what coding standards look like in practice is to look at some code for reference.
Here is an example of good code, everything is formatted neatly and you can see the indentation for the lines to help separate the code. The code provided was taken from one of the exercises in the ICS 314 class.
  
  findMenuItems(ingredient){
  	let itemsToReturn = [];
    	for (let menuItem of this.menuItems){
				if (menuItem.ingredients.indexOf(ingredient) >= 0){
        		itemsToReturn.push(menuItem);
        }
      }
      return itemsToReturn;
  	} 
	}

This is what poorly formatted code looks like, each line is had to distinguish from each other because they all look the same at first glance.
   findMenuItems(ingredient){
   let itemsToReturn = [];
   for (let menuItem of this.menuItems){
	 if (menuItem.ingredients.indexOf(ingredient) >= 0){
   itemsToReturn.push(menuItem);
   }
   }
   return itemsToReturn;
   } 
	 }
